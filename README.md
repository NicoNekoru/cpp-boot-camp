# cpp-boot-camp

These pages are intended to cover essential C and C++ topic, using a mix of notes and code samples

Content is derived from multiple sources, mainly from the University of Washington's [CSE 333](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/) (Systems Programming) course

Also (hopefully) a nice read for new [Husky Satellite Lab](https://huskysat.org/) members!
